# Microsoft Power BI PWC PowerBI Virtual Case Experience

# Introduction
This repository displays the process and outcomes of the tasks completed during the PwC Switzerland PowerBI Virtual Case Experience developed by Forage. The virtual internship is created to simulate work in the Digital Accelerator team at PwC Switzerland and leverages Power BI.

All of these .pbix files and insights were my submissions for this program, except for the data files which were assigned by PwC Switzerland.


# ðŸ“Œ Scenario

At PwC, we work with global organizations, upskilling our 276,000 employees. Our goal is to provide everyone with the opportunity to learn, work, and participate in the digital world. Our employees have the chance to become "Digital Accelerators" by rapidly deepening their skills in digital specialties such as data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling. They do this by learning self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business. Your manager, Giulia, will guide you through your upskilling journey in PowerBI. You'll become a data Jedi and Digital Accelerator. An important client (communication has already reached out to you for help visualizing their data.

This virtual experience program consists of 3 tasks:

## Task 1: Create Call Centre Dashboard - visualizing customer and agent behavior.
Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Task 2: Create Customer Retention and predict churn customers - visualizing customer demographics and insights.

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
- We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that itâ€™s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

## Task 3: Create Diversity and Inclusion in HR - visualizing gender balance in the executive suite.

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. Theyâ€™ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but theyâ€™re not seeing any progress. Theyâ€™re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

- number of men
- number of women
- number of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women
